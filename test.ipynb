I think he chose this stream because a lot of people (esp on Twitter) seem to just give him hate because of a lot of the preconceived social “norms” *the man is always wrong, ect* without really understanding the nuances within a relationship and how especially medical stuff is almost one of the hardest tests on a relationship.', 'dude was also clearly on the right side even if you only listened to her story lmao', 'Wording it that way implies that he wanted any of this interesting first place. Of course he wants this to be over.', 'That’s exactly where my head went as well.', 'it would be funny as fuck if he did a gus johnson impression for some dumbass video like “march madness buzzer beaters be like”', \"This is the video I always think about when I hear Gus Johnson's name. I don't think it'd play out very well anymore though...\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUcWXyPHEd0\", \"more so than that. it's not just a heat of the moment spot of revenge. the fact she's said spiteful shit since then shows she is on a crusade which completely overshadows what could have been a powerful, moving story about her trauma and a discussion about the failure of the medical system around her\", 'Considering Gen Z has the lowest level of relationship experience of any generational cohort of young adults and adolescents since data on that stuff has been tracked, a good number of Gen Z lol.', \"I mean she said that his neglect nearly lead to her death. Id say that's pretty complex.\", 'Completely agree. And from what the story sounds like (even from sabrina\\'s side as long as you take into account that she is obviously biased in her direction). It doesn\\'t even sound like he was a shitty boyfriend, they just went through a rough time.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell his worst crimes were \\n\\n1) During a period where she had an unknown medical condition that the doctors told them not to worry about, they had been back and forth to the doctors and hospitals a lot. On One specific day she told him she was going to the hospital again, he said he would come after a business arrangement he had. At they time neither of then knew how serious the situation was, he did come over after his meeting and they then learned how serious the situation was and he stayed with her at the hospital for her operation.\\n\\nThis is not being a bad boyfriend. This is just a bad situation. If he had gone to the hospital with her and it had turned out to be nothing there is a chance that would hurt her or their relationship from the other side, because she\\'d feel guilty or it would put a further strain on the relationship because he cancelled this thing unnecessarily. There is no clear right or wrong answer here.\\n\\n2) After they had agreed they were not ready to have a baby, she got pregnant. Gus was not open to changing his position on whether they should keep it.\\n\\nIt seems like contrary to sabrinas video they did talk about it. He was just not open to being swayed. Which again is not a \\'bad boyfriend\\' move. It\\'s a a shitty situation with no wrong moves. If he starts humoring her or considering the possibility with her its going to make the process of terminating it much more difficult for both of them.\\n\\nFrom what I understand at this point they had been dating in person for a few months. They both moved to LA recently were strapped for cash and nobody knew Gus would reach the kind of success he did. If you are open to having an abortion it also seems morally the right thing to do for the kid, because I think having a kid you are not ready for in a situation like this is rolling the dice with the kids future. After what happened and how gus talked about the relationship yesterday it seems clear that this would probably not have been a healthy home to grow up in.\\n\\n\\n3) He didn\\'t go to Couples Therapy with her.\\n\\nHe went to whatever couples specialist she provided and seems like they both gave it a try, the fact that this is even brought up in the way it was says a lot about Sabrina to me, but even so it\\'s not like not wanting to go to therapy makes you a terrible person. \\n\\n\\n4) He said some mean things during arguments or difficult times.\\n\\nI can\\'t remember every minute detail but it sounds like one of the worst things he said to her is \"Anyone else would have broken up with you by now\" during a several month long period of her essentially breaking down mentally. People fight in relationships. They argue. They say horrible or hurtful things to each other. This does not make them bad people. This happens even in good relationships but when you are in a downwards spiralling relationship for a long period its even more likely to happen. \\n\\n\\nNothing in this story from either side makes it seem like anything Gus has said or did is done in like a concerted effort to try to break her spirit or be mean to her. It\\'s just a shitty situation for both of them and he is just being human and saying things he regrets sometimes.\\n\\n\\nNow Sabrina on the other hand comes across as much more of a bad actor. As Gus and Wubby said and I will say as well I don\\'t think anyone should try to \\'go after\\' or \\'get back\\' at her even if what she did is completely beyond the pale. Gus just wants to be done with it and she has obviously suffered a lot and she should just be left alone. I mean I think this is true generally, random people on the internet should never take it on themselves to harass or try to ruin the lives of random public personas based on normal human conflict or failings (e.g not clearly predatory or abusive behaviour.) \\n\\n\\nBut it seems increasingly clear that she basically used a difficult time they went through as well as a difficult breakup they had, and weaponised that against him for the purpose of hurting him and his career after he did not want to get back together. Unlike everything Gus has done in this situation, that is not within the bounds of what is acceptable between two partners. \\n\\n\\nSorry for the long rant,  have just gone through a similar situation as what they did (With the unknown diagnosis, back and forth to hospitals and declining mental health). My situation didn\\'t go the way theirs did, but it still broke my heart to hear his side of the story yesterday (which is already how it seemed like it went down based on Sabrinas side)  and I just wanted to vent a bit :] \\n\\n\\nAnother great example of why I think the internet as a whole needs to calm down when it comes to being an overzealous vigilante moral police of peoples personal affairs.', 'it was clout chasing and a takedown at the same time. two with one stone.', '[deleted]', \"10000% its what i think every time i see shit like this. why do these people insist on making these things everyone's business? it literally never ends well\", 'yup. this has been such a toxic shitty rollercoaster that I never asked to get on but continues to get thrown up here and there. if this woman has a fucking problem with him then take it up with him and/or in court, and they can deal with it in private as they always should have.', 'Between hearing Gus being absolutely emotionally spent AND again listening to the horrors Sabrina went through; I was emotional the entire time. I’ve been in emotionally draining points of my life. Nothing is fun, so for Wubby to take it in stride and let the man vent was the absolute best thing he could’ve done. It wasn’t an interview as much as it was letting Gus talk and let go of these emotions all at once. Unless you’ve felt such a deep emotional pain, you don’t have a right to speak on the subject. You can recognize the pain from a mile away. Both parties felt the pain and it’s important that both parties have been given proper outlets to express themselves', '[deleted]', 'Agreed, very well spoken and quite fair.', 'Here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1448514349?t=02h23m32s', \"The entire stream tonight was centered around the gus/sabrina situation, so it might actually be worth watching the whole vod, however, the stream also ended shortly after gus' interview was over, so if you just go backwards from the end, you should find it quickly.\", 'oh bro, fucking rip man. thank god vods are a thing, eh?', \"This also wasn't planned at all.

Especially after MONTHS of verbal abuse online, people slandering your name, and having no real understanding as to why this was public knowledge in the first place. It's no wonder he sounds so worn out. The man has been through some serious emotional trauma, and I hope he seeks help and is able to return to normalcy. \\n\\nAs for Sabrina, from the sound of it she may have actually been having PTSD from the pregnancy, which is impossible for anyone to understand what it's like if they haven't experienced it themself. As someone with PTSD I can sympathize with the panic attacks and the desperation she must have been feeling.\\n\\nThe whole thing is so shitty and that extreme level of emotional trauma can make people do and say things that they normally wouldn't have in a million years otherwise. When it gets multiplied on a public stage and is put under a magnifying glass, people will come to conclusions about their character which to me is completely unfair given the circumstances. I have no doubt that both sides have regrets about things they've said and done throughout the ordeal. I wish both of them the best, I hope they're able to recover from all of this.\", 'No matter what was true, it still has nothing to do with us or his videos/comedy.

I don’t agree with what she was saying mostly but she also didn’t get to speak for more than 10 seconds without being cut off so it’s possible she could’ve provided more to her points. The chat was awful too, I could already tell they were going to disagree with all her points no matter what as soon as she joined. \\n\\n\\nI think Wubby was great at and should stick to interviewing people involved instead of someone with an outsiders perspective on the situation. He was writing off their every point as them not knowing anything about it, which should have been an obvious outcome when he dragged a random chatter in to the call.', \"Yep.

It literally happens all the time with both men and women.\\n\\nI think you can look at any long-term relationship between young people and find a patch of time where one person was shitty to the other. One wasn't there for the other when needed. You can paint a picture using specific details when really it's just how this shit goes.

He asked to be present when she spoke to a doctor once so he could make sure she wasn\\'t over exaggerating her symptoms.\\n\\nEven in the interview the dude makes it clear he didn\\'t believe she needed to go to the doctor as often as she did post surgery. He paints it as all in her head and just panic attacks which sure might have been the truth but at the time how could you not believe her? Especially when she was already dismissed by doctors and ended up being right that something worse was happening? The doctors believed she just needed to take Tylenol and let the miscarriage happen and guess what they were wrong and she almost died. So for Gus to just keep dismissing her medical experiences even to this day is gag inducing.\\n\\nAs for couples counseling it came out that he spent at least some of the time discussing his desire to open the relationship up or in Sabrina\\'s words \"fuck other people.\" In the interview he basically confirms this by saying she took part of what they discussed in counseling out of context but bro you still discussed your desire to fuck other people after your girlfriend wanted to go to counseling to repair your relationship.\\n\\nTo be honest it\\'s clear in the interview he was unhappy having to be her caretaker in the aftermath of the ectopic pregnancy as basically took out his frustrations on her with emotionally damaging comments that he dismisses as \"dumb stuff I said\" which I reiterate is dismissive of how much harm he caused.\\n\\nHe keeps sharing that he apologized for his comments multiple times but that to me is a red flag. She clearly was damaged by what he said to her and it added to her PTSD. He apologized but in a way that wasn\\'t enough i.e. he had to keep apologizing. He basically strikes me as someone who feels they can say \"whoops sorry let\\'s move on\" without actually doing the work to recognize why what he said was harmful and take the time to be truly remorseful especially when he just characterizes the comments as dumb instead of damaging.\\n\\nLooping back though he was clearly annoyed his girlfriend was damaged and not a fun perky girl anymore after her medical trauma. Their relationship was on the rocks and he says they were roommates essentially which reading between the lines means no sex. So instead of cutting his losses and moving on he goes to counseling and tries to open the relationship which is pretty gross tbh. If you\\'re gonna be committed to someone, be committed and help support them through the bad times! Instead he added to her trauma, strung her along in a bad relationship, and eventually dumped her so he could date a non broken girl.\\n\\nEven her trying to get back with him I understand. I had a shitty ex bf who was hard to leave because trauma does bond people together and even after they hurt you, if you love them there\\'s this incessant desire to stick it out and make it work. Ultimately she was clearly still invested in the relationship though in the interview he tries to make it sound mutual that they both checked out.... Like no brother you checked out and clearly dipped when she became too damaged for you.

I think there are some fundamental ideas that I disagree with both you and the other guy on but I do appreciate the in depth explanation', 'Did we watch the same interview? You are making a TON of assumptions. \\n\\n1. When did he say he didn\\'t believe her? He said he went with her regularly to the doctor when they thought she was going through a miscarriage. He said he listened to what the doctors believed was the case. Should the doctors have done a better job? Absolutely. And he said that. Repeatedly. Her medical trauma is 100% valid. Should he have been there sooner on the day she went in and found out she had a life-threatening situation? Maybe? I think it\\'s completely valid that after visiting the doctor 12 times in a month and having a prior business engagement, he felt that it was ok to take care of his business first before going to join her at the doctor. At the time, neither of them knew what was actually happening, which was the DOCTOR\\'S fault, not Gus\\'s. To me, it seems like he did the best he could in the given situation.\\n2. What happened after the surgery was a ROUGH time for them. From what he said, Sabrina was experiencing extreme PTSD and having anxiety attacks that led to them getting very little sleep for weeks at times. If my timeline is correct, they had only actually started living together post-surgery since she needed his support. Imagine going from living alone (or with a roommate) and dating someone straight into what they had to deal with. And not only deal with, but maintain a public image and put out content in order to sustain themselves. Could you imagine yourself becoming a bit frustrated over the situation? A bit upset? Maybe expressing that frustration in an unhealthy way or with some unkind words? Do you honestly think that a situation as complicated as their relationship and the trauma they were going through is simple enough to boil down into \"Gus is a piece of shit\"?\\n3. Also, where in the interview are you getting that Gus is dismissing her medical experience? He literally says SEVERAL TIMES that he didn\\'t want to discredit or dismiss the traumatic experience she went through, and EVEN WRAPPED UP THE INTERVIEW BY SAYING THAT BECAUSE OF THIS EXPERIENCE HE BELIEVES THAT WOMEN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY TREATED MORE POORLY BY DOCTORS. Really, THAT should have been the overall message from Sabrina\\'s video. And if they had made the video together during the 3  YEARS they stayed together after the surgery, maybe they could have made something that had a positive impact.\\n4. \"It\\'s clear in the interview he was unhappy having to be her caretaker in the aftermath of the ectopic pregnancy..\" My homie in CHRIST. Not everyone in the world is perfect and able to handle being a caretaker the same way. This was a SUPER difficult time for them. He let her move in with him, took care of living expenses, took her to the doctor when she had PTSD induced panic attacks in the middle of the night.. They were both getting very little sleep at times. Would you be happy? Would you be \\\\*absolutely stoked\\\\* to be going through this kind of a situation with your significant other? I would question your sanity if you were. It was a shitty situation and he has every right to not sound happy while discussing it. \\n5. As far as the \"dumb stuff he said\" and him needing to apologize better, I\\'m sorry but neither of us truly know what was said during those difficult times. And even if he did say some really nasty things to her, can you at least acknowledge that we have very little context of what was actually happening during their relationship? Have you ever been in a long term relationship with someone who is experiencing trauma? It sucks some days. You argue some days. You feel cold towards your partner some days. You question their and your own sanity some days. And other days you do your best to be there for them. That\\'s human nature. I guarantee, most people who have ex-S.O.s would be able to say that their exes said or did some horrible shit to them at one point or another. The big difference is that we aren\\'t public figures. The point at which arguments or hurtful words become abuse should definitely be discussed and anyone in an abusive relationship should have resources in order to get out of them. I don\\'t believe that was the case here, but that\\'s really not my place to say. And neither is it yours.\\n6. As far as \"opening up the relationship\" goes, this is \\\\*again\\\\* you making a huge assumption. This is based off of Sabrina sharing (in a very unkind way) something that was said to a therapist IN PRIVATE. And it sounds like, from what Gus said, to be something COMPLETELY out of context. It could have even been a subject that was brought up by the therapist: \"You both seem to be having a really rough time together. Have you considered giving each other some space?\" And from there maybe the subject of a separation or seeing other people could have been discussed. But the truth is this: WE DON\\'T KNOW. An we don\\'t deserve to know. And making assumptions about something private that was discussed in therapy and then weaponized in order to hurt someone is NOT the play.\\n7. You said that he was \"annoyed his girlfriend was damaged and not a fun perky girl anymore\" which is \\\\*yet again\\\\* not what he said. He said during the last year \"it was a dead relationship\" and clarified by saying that they weren\\'t spending much free time together. That they had been trying to keep their relationship alive by going to a couples therapist that she found. Saying that he \"just wanted to fuck other people\" is malicious and completely discrediting. And again, something that was likely taken out of context from something said during a therapy session. He also said \"people asked \\'why didn\\'t you guys break up sooner?\\'\" They were in a 4 year relationship at that point, living in a house together, having a dog and a life together. They were co-dependent at that point and were trying everything they could to stay together. \"Cutting his losses\" (which makes breaking up from a long-term relationship sound so easy) was not a first choice.\\n8. Him turning down her advances after their break up was the correct thing to do. At that point, he knew they were no longer compatible. You said yourself he should have \"cut his losses.\" And again, you make a huge assumption: he checked out? How can you think that with such certainty? Were you there? Were you a part of their relationship? If he had been the one to check out, why did he continue to try to fix the relationship with counseling? And even if he had checked out and all of the therapy and counseling was a front, are you really saying that their relationship troubles and the distance that grew between them was 100% his fault? Is it really that black and white to you? I can\\'t say that. All I can say is \"wow, it sounds like they had a really shitty situation that really fucked up their relationship. That sucks.\"\\n\\nI\\'m sorry to hear you had a shitty experience with an ex-bf. That had to suck. But I feel like a lot of the arguments I read, including yours, come from people putting their own experiences onto what they perceive from others. And while that is understandable, I don\\'t think applying personal bias from our own past experiences is valid beyond saying \"damn, relationships are complicated and tough.\" Abuse definitely happens, and people in abusive relationships should 100% be heard and have the ability to get our of those relationships, but I really don\\'t think that\\'s what happened here. The video Sabrina released about her trauma could have been something that they made together in order to expose how women are often treated poorly by medical professionals, and how it disrupted their relationship and what they learned from it. Instead, she weaponized her trauma in order to take away Gus\\'s career. She called people he worked with in order to get them to stop working with him. She did everything she could to cancel him. Even though she went through something traumatic, that doesn\\'t mean she can\\'t do something shitty too. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL,DR: Relationships are complicated and tough.

People jump to way too many conclusions, it's mental.\", \"Some responses as I think in a few of these you missed my point and in a few I totally agree with you, I was just giving her possible POV and yes speculating.\\n\\n1. By not believing her I mean the way he frames the post surgery period where he brings up going to the doctor many times a week over her panicking, the implication is that she wasn't experiencing real medical symptoms and it was in her head. He would want to be present to make sure she didn't over exaggerate her symptoms which is a clear indicator he thought she was the girl crying wolf several times. You and I can say well sure she was going way too often and saying this will be the time they discover the real problem and it's normal not to believe her at that point but at the end of the day he was her partner and he didn't validate her experiences he cast aspersions on them. He and Wubby constantly say they support her and hate doctors while simultaneously writing off her post surgery experiences as just PTSD/anxiety and constant doctor visits. They don't even bring up his behavior she outlined in her video where he would doubt her symptoms! It's like she had to go through a second near death experience to be believed by her own boyfriend even after the doctors fucked up the first time around wtf\\n\\n2. I totally agree with you here and I can relate to Gus. I think everyone in a long term relationship has fucked up and said some hurtful things to their partner before. I also believe the dude doesn't currently show a true understanding of how he harmed her or at least he doesn't acknowledge it to us the audience. I do speculate he didn't show it to Sabrina either because she still feels the hurt he caused and definitely didn't truly accept his apologies. Is that because she's vengeful? Probably but shit I don't see him addressing the comments for what they are. Instead I see him calling them stupid shit he said which is just alarms bells for anyone who's ever gotten an insincere apology.\\n\\n3. Again he acknowledges the experience with the surgery and PTSD but straight up still believes she was making up a lot of stuff in her head which is toxic AF to experience from her end. Imagine having your partner demand to correct the symptoms you are reporting to the doctor 🤮 He needs to own up to that shit because he is part of the problem! He is one of the people who didn't trust a woman's experience, probably at least partially because she's a woman. Misogyny is insidious and pervasive in society and this is a clear example. Reminds me of the Dave Chappelle skit about police brutality... y'all didn't believe we were getting beat up until you read it on Newsweek lmao\\n\\n4. I totally agree with you here. Being a caregiver is seriously hard and burnout is common. I do think there's something to be said about women vs men ability to care for an ill partner though if you look at the rates that men divorce their wives after a serious diagnosis. That is a societal problem and not an individual one, I don't blame men for leaving their partners due to burnout and an unhealthy dynamic but I do think it'd be interesting to explore the reasons why men tend to leave or cheat when their partners go through serious debilitating life experiences...\\n\\n4. The person I was replying to was asking for her side of the story. So I went based on stuff she shared. I know Gus said he doesn't remember exactly what was said and tbh that doesn't surprise me at all. She was the one who was hurt deeply by his actions and words so it does make sense she remembers how he made her feel with his comments. So yes I do believe her when she says he told her that anyone would have left her by now or that he asked to be present for her doctor's visit so he could make sure she wasn't exaggerating or that he expressed a desire to fuck other people.\\n\\n6. Sure bud she just made that shit up out of something small because she's an unhinged vengeful ex. Notice how he acknowledges she shared something discussed in counseling. He had no issue calling out her false statements in that interview - if she was way off the mark he would've shared it. 100% that man shared his desire to fuck other people during counseling. He dodged that question so hard and notice how neither him nor Wubby faced that head on because it's definitely eyebrow raising. I do agree she broke his trust and violated his privacy in sharing it btw but that doesn't mean I'm gonna ignore that it happened. Definitely gag inducing.\\n\\n7. I totally agree that it's hard to leave and I don't blame either one for not leaving sooner. I do feel bad for Gus being thrust just as much as her into a complicated nasty situation I was just centering Sabrina's experiences in my comment because it was what was asked.\\n\\n8. I am totally speculating on the he checked out stuff. He presents it as a mutual thing but I personally feel she was a lot more invested in keeping the relationship alive because she searched for counseling, tried to get back together, and generally comes across as a woman scorned and discarded. He said the relationship was roommates (probably no sex), dead in the water, wanted to start fucking other people, and generally seemed over it by the time it ended. So that's the vibe I get: he was over her and she was not over him. Could be wrong but I think the stuff shared by the both of them points that way.\\n\\nEDIT: oh yeah btw I totally agree she is acting out of vengeance and trying to cancel him! Not making excuses for her behavior in that regard but it doesn't make me see Gus any differently. She definitely aired that dirty laundry and the bell can't be unrung. I personally can't see him in the same light anymore and that's very sad as a long time fan. If I had to outline what I would want to see on his end it would be to fully acknowledge where he was and still continues to be shitty. It's hard but you gotta acknowledge where you fucked up to convince anyone you've grown and he hasn't personally convinced me of jack diddly squat.\\n\\nI don't think he's irredeemable and definitely think Wubby was doing the right thing to give him a platform. I hope he has a full recovery and regains his following and I also hope he grows up and actually reflects on how he acted and where he was wrong in the situation for personal growth.\", \"I do not blame Gus for everything - my comment was trying to explain Sabrina's side and was very speculative on what her POV looks like. I mostly agree with everything you've said here and I do feel bad for Gus and don't agree with her going scorched earth on his ass.\\n\\nThough I definitely get where her rage comes from and impulse to go scorched earth... I'd be tempted too tbh and I wish I was her friend so I could've sat her ass down and talked her out of it because at the end of the day it helps no one.

Gus was 22/23 at the time of this shitshow while being her sole form of support, both emotionally and fiscally. he's going to 3-4 trips to the doctors a week and is running on little sleep. idk bout y'all but i'm going to be a fucking mess emotionally in that circumstance. to think the worst thing he seemingly did was say some unfortunate shit, well, that's simply not that bad.\", \"Then why'd she try to get him back if she was relieved to be away from him\", 'Can I ask you a question? Have you ever been in a relationship?', 'They agreed to terminate a pregnancy beforehand and she was supposed to join them afterwards for drinks since it was a routine appointment. As soon as it was serious Gus rushed to the hospital.\\n\\nOf course it sounds bad when you misrepresent the situation and frame him in the worst possible light.', '[removed]', \"To the first part, they had a mutual agreement that if she got pregnant, she should get an abortion, because they weren't ready for a child, which also included financially according to Gus. She even went to get the abortion, but I think there was confusion about how far along she was, and she ended up getting second opinions from nurses and the likes about potentially going through with the pregnancy. \\n\\nNow put yourself in Gus's shoes. He wasn't ready to have a child, neither emotionally or financially, and had an agreement with Sabrina that they would terminate if she ever got pregnant, but suddenly she goes back on that and asks him to consider it again. Obviously it's a shitty situation for her to be in, but it's also a shitty position to put him in, when they clearly had had conversations about this beforehand and determined that it wasn't gonna happen at that point in time. I'm not really sure whether she was suggesting keeping the baby, or if she was just suggesting to go through with the pregnancy, and put it up for adoption, because she doesn't really specify in the video. Regardless, I don't agree with the notion that it was wrong for him to make it about himself, when it's literally her suggesting going against pre-established agreements, to do something he doesn't want to, which will also affect his life. I don't think he sounds entirely unreasonable in standing firm on his stance. \\n\\nAnd I don't entirely agree with saying he is forcing the abortion on her. You can make a case for it, but based on what she said in her video, the main way he was forcing her was by staying form on not wanting a child, and saying he would break up with her if she went through with it, which leaves her the option of raising it alone. But on the contrary, she was also forcing him to have a child, which they had agreed on not having. I can sympathize with Sabrina in the situation, but I don't see Gus as being in the wrong.\\n\\nOn your second point, that's just not entirely correct. She didn't ask him to take her, she told him she was going to the hospital and asked him to come. This was after multiple doctor's visits, where medical professionals had said it wasn't anything serious, that it was likely a miscarriage that would pass on its own. So at the time, neither of them knew how serious it was. Gus elaborated here, saying he had a scheduled podcast with some guests, which was also crowdfunded, so he felt a personal obligation to see it through. He didn't mention anything about the going out for drinks thing, but he did say he went to the hospital after, so it was always his intention to go, and he didn't 'refuse to take her'. I think it's hard to judge this without knowing the minutae of their phone conversation, because if she did tell him how serious it felt, I 100% think he should've gone immediately, but if it sounded like the other times, where they had been told it was nothing to worry about, I can understand him prioritizing work. Not the best move of a boyfriend, but not cancel-worthy, I'd say.\", \"Right, but wasn't that after they had already agreed to abort in the event of an accidental pregnancy?

Arguably, keeping a child when both partners agreed to abort is worse.', 'No, because a woman ultimately has the right to choose whether she keeps a child because it’s in HER body and statistically is more likely to be left with the burden of raising a child in circumstances such as these. There is ultimately more risk for women in these kinds of situations.
